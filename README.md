What Does This Do?
-
This tool lets you visualize numerical difficulty values found in Rock Band DTA files. For example, a song may have a Guitar difficulty of 330. Going to the Guitar tab and entering 330 will reveal it is 4 dots in difficulty. The slider can be moved freely and the dots can be clicked on to change difficulty.

Every instrument and some Pro parts have different thresholds as interpreted by the game. Band can be averaged based on the user-inputted values of the other parts.

Devil Tier is the highest tier, though many songs exceed the limit at which it appears, which this tool also supports, up to 600.

What This Does Not Do
-
This tool does not import values from a DTA file.
